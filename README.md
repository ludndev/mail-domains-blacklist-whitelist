# Mail Domains Blacklist/Whitelist Repository

This repository contains lists of email domains categorized as blacklisted or whitelisted. It aims to provide a reference for blocking or allowing specific email domains based on security or filtering criteria.

## Blacklisted Domains

The `blacklisted_domains.txt` file includes domains that are considered malicious, spammy, or otherwise harmful. Emails originating from these domains are blocked to enhance the security of the system.

## Whitelisted Domains

The `whitelisted_domains.txt` file includes domains that are trusted and explicitly allowed. Emails from these domains will not be flagged or blocked, ensuring that legitimate communication is not affected.

## Usage

- Use the `blacklisted_domains.txt` file to configure your system to block emails from known harmful domains.
- Use the `whitelisted_domains.txt` file to ensure that emails from trusted domains are not erroneously flagged or blocked.

## Contributing

If you have suggestions for additional domains to be blacklisted or whitelisted, please open an issue or submit a pull request. Contributions are welcome to enhance the effectiveness of the domain lists.
